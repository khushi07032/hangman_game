# hangman_game
Version 1: The Version 1.1 had been developed. Currently, it displays a background which covers only half of the screen with alphabeths appearing on the far left. Furthermore, the background appearing behind the hangman image is different then the rest. To mark these technical problem, the developer can make certain changes. Instead of using a different background, the developer can use the same background for the whole setup. In addition with using the same background, the developer can use an enlarged image so that the background covers the whole screen. These are the changes that developer can made.

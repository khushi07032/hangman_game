#Problems and solutions of our project:

Version 1.1: The Version 1.1 had been developed. Currently, it displays a background which covers only half of the screen with alphabeths appearing on the far left. Furthermore, the background appearing behind the hangman image is different than the rest. To mark these technical problems, the developer can make certain changes. Instead of using a different background, the developer can use the same background for the whole setup. In addition with using the same background, the developer can use an enlarged image so that the background covers the whole screen. These are the changes that developer can make.

Version 1.2: During the testing of Version 1.1, the tester discovered that the alphabet doesn't turn red upon clicking, that is they remain green. The tester notified the developer about the technical issue and suggested certain changes that are needed to be made. 

Version 1.3: As suggested earlier, the developer upgraded the previous version with certain improvements, resulting in Version 1.3, a much refined version of the game. Upon testing the version 1.3, the tester found  no issue, and the Version 1.3 of the game was finalized.
